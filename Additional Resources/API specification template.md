Regarding the sections of this template, the *general information section* contains several fields that allows describing metadata such as the name, version, description, license, and the base URL of the API. In addition, the authorization field allows describing whether credentials or token are or not required for consuming the API. Moreover, the contact field allows providing information on who contact for API support.

As for the *details of API path section*, it allows listing the paths and the available operations for each path together with their inputs and outputs. Finally, the *status codes section* allows defining which code numbers will be delivered to application developers based on the status of the executed operation. These codes should be provided along with their description and detail. These codes are those HTTP status codes defined by [RFC7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231\#section-6), HTTP status codes are the common codes used in REST APIs.
